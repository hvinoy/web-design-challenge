<h1 class="title-style"> Summary: Latitude vs.X</h1>   

<img src= "Resources/assets/images/Fig1.png">
<p> The purpose of this project was to nalyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator.
    To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset
    on over 500 cities.
</p>
<p> After assembling the dataset. we used Matpotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude.
    Factors we looked included: temperature,cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data.
    and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and 
    correlations witnessed.
